The OCD Awareness App is a desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter to provide users with essential information about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). 
The app is designed to raise awareness about OCD, educate users on its different types, offer exercises to help manage symptoms, and provide an OCD score through a self-assessment quiz. 
This project does not require a database and operates as a standalone application with all data stored locally.
